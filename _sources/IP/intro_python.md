# Introduction to Python for Earth and Environmental Sciences

In this first chapter, which you may *skip if you are an experienced Python programmer*, we will guide you through the basics of Python that will allow you to sail through the rest of the book. This includes the basics of variables, control flow, file I/O, data structure, functions, and classes in Python. We then introduce cornerstone Python libraries: 
-  `Numpy` for scientific computing, 
-  `Matplotlib` and `Cartopy` for visualization,
-  `Pandas` for tabular data analysis,
-  `Geopandas` for geospatial data analysis,
-  `Scikit-learn` for statistical modeling, and
-  `Seaborn` for statistical graphics.
